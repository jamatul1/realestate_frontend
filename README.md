## Overview

Welcome to the Real Estate Application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) technology stack. This application is designed to provide a seamless and efficient experience for users looking to buy or rent properties. With features like location-based property search, an advanced filtering system, an interactive map, and agent accounts, this platform aims to simplify the real estate search process.

## Features

### 1. Location-Based Property Search

Easily find properties in the desired location using the location-based search feature. The application utilizes geolocation data to help users discover properties in specific areas or neighborhoods.

### 2. Advanced Filtering System

Refine the property search with the advanced filtering system. Users can filter properties based on various criteria such as price range, and number of bedrooms. This ensures that users can find the properties that match their specific requirements.

### 3. Interactive Map

Visualize property locations on an interactive map for a better understanding of the surrounding area. The map feature allows users to explore the neighborhood.

### 4. Agent Account

Real estate agents can create accounts on the platform to showcase their listings and connect with potential clients. Agents have the ability to manage their property listings and respond to inquiries.

### 5. Responsive Design

the application is built with a responsive design to ensure a consistent and user-friendly experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
